# tidy_and_visualize
 This project aims at tidying data and visualizing it
 
 In brief, the application will have 3 tabs:
 - Tab1 named "upload" will serve for parsing a CSV file
 - Tab2 named "tidy it!" will have some functionalities for tidying the data (can be expanded as we get new ideas)
 - Tab3 named "visualize it!" will help plot some variables, and we hope to add support for many different plot types...
